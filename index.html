				<h1> Connecting the City</h1>
				<h2>An arrangement of constantly flowing networks </h2>
			
				<p> Wellington City is a sprawling city that reaches out over many suburbs, passing through hills and waterways. Bridges and Tunnels are the prime way that the city remains connected together. The Internet is a similar place with cables and wires essentially providing all the connetiosn neccessary for it to run smoothly. </p>

				<h1>Tunnels </h1>
				<p> Wellington has many different Tunnels due to its harsh landscape that involved pathways to be built through the hillsides. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="citycontent"> 

			<h2> Wrights Hill Fortress Tunnel </h2>
<img src="images/wrightshill.png"> 

<div class="splitright">
<p> This tunnel is an old military fortress built in World War II in the suburb of Karori. Its numerous underground tunnels like the one pictured here were used to connect war shelters, gun emplacements and plotting rooms. This tunnel displays one of Wellingtons very first needs for connecting people toegther, out of sight. </p>

</div>

<h2> Rimutaka Rail Tunnel </h2>

<img src="images/rimutaka.png">

<div class="splitright">
<p> The Rimutaka Rail Tunnel runs from Upper Hutt and is currently the longest tunnel in New Zealand that holds scheduled passenger trains. This tunnel is a major connection for people living in the outer suburbs of Wellington as a way to get into the city. </p>
</div>

<h2> Mount Victoria Tunnel </h2>

<img src="images/mtvic.png">

<div class="splitright">
<p> The Mount Victoria Tunnel connects the suburb of Hataitai to the centre of Wellington. This tunnel has greatly improved travelling time for motorists driving into the city. This can be compared to a high speed internet cable, that provides convenience and effeciency to people that use it.
 </p>
 </div>


<h2> Hataitai Bus Tunnel </h2>

<img src="images/Hataitai.png">


<div class="splitright">
<p> The Hataitai Bus Tunnel is only to be used by buses to try and provide a convenient route where buses dont have to wait in traffic. The tunnel is very restricting as noted by the somewhat aggresive sign that denys entry to motorists. Only one bus may pass through this tunnel at once giving resemblance to some of the older internet infrastructures that allowed little gage for internet traffic only allowing small amounts of data through. 
</p>
</div>


<h2> Terrace Motorway Tunnel </h2>

<img src="images/terrace.png">

<div class="splitright">
<p> The Terrace Motorway Tunnel runs through State Highway One and is known for causing congestions in traffic due to its 3 lane design, where merging is required as you exit. This is a major tunnel in New Zealand where they are working towards creating a better traffic flow. Reflecting on Internet Infrastructure, without these test practises in connecting pat together we will never find futher development in high speed Internet. Just like we might not otherwise develop better tunnel/road plans. 
</p>
</div>

<h2> Arras Tunnel </h2>

<img src="images/arras.png">

<div class="splitright">
<p> The Arras Tunnel was built in 2014 so is by far the most recently built tunnel in Wellington. The tunnel differentiates from the rest with its more modern approach, not sticking with the saem semi-circular shape.

			<div class="splitright1"> 
			<p> Throughout the whole of Wellington there happens to only be one bridge. Although this bridge offers pedestrains a safe way over the motorway, connecting them from the city to the sea. This bridge acts as an aid to pedestrains while also providing a unique and artistic design. </p>
